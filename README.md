# whitespace encoder

Hides secret messages using whitespace only (invisible) characters.

In 2001, I was given a shareware CD with a program called [SNOW](http://www.darkside.com.au/snow/) on a shareware CD. SNOW was my first encounter with steganography and I've always wanted to implement my own take on SNOW's concept.

## Usage

Only plaintext (ASCII only) files are supported at the moment, such as those made in `notepad.exe`

#### Encode

```console
$ node whitespace.js [INPUT FILE] [OUTPUT FILE]
```

#### Decode

```console
$ node whitespace.js [ENCODED FILE]
```
